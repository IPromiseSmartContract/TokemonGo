# TokemoGo For ETH Taipei 2024

## TokemonGo: A Game Integrating GameFi and SocialFi

**Introduction**

TokemonGo merges cryptocurrency and gaming, allowing players to bet on crypto combinations against others, with victories determined by asset value. It enhances earnings through Dyson Finance and incorporates SocialFi elements by engaging fans through Mint Club tokens, all within a secure USDC-based economy.

**Game Process**

- **Game Setup:** The Master sets a game collateral threshold, such as 100 USDC, and the game's deadline.
- **Token Combination For Master:** Master create a token combination equal to the value of 100 USDC (for example, `0.01 ETH and 0.001 BTC = Total 100 USDC`).
- **Token Combination For Challenger** Challengers can stake 100 USDC to propose a better token combination. 
- **Who will Win?** The winner is the one with the higher value asset combination when the game time ends.

**Yield Generation:**

- **Enhancing Yields with Dyson:** the game duration exceeds one day, staked assets are invested in `Dyson Finance` through dual investment strategies. This generates yields for GameFi, SocialFi, and NFT DApps, enhancing the overall value and engagement within the ecosystem.
  
- **Test Insight:** Test results from running `AutoDepositDysonTest.ts` illustrate that with a 10u stake from each player, TokemonGo successfully generates a yield of ðŸ’°0.293 USDC through Dyson Finance.

**To run the test yourself and observe the yield generation in action, follow the instructions below:**

For installation details and initial setup, please refer to the [How To Run?](#how-to-run) section. Once setup is complete, execute the following command to run the specific test:



```
pnpm --filter tokemon-go-contracts exec hardhat test test/AutoDepositDysonTest.ts
```


**SocialFi Integration:**

- **Fan Tokens:** `Mint Club` is used to create fan tokens for Masters and Challengers, allowing the community to purchase fan tokens of the players they support and bet on their game outcomes.
- **Mechnism For Fans Token:** The losing side's fan tokens are burned, enhancing the value of the winning side's fan tokens.

**Circle USDC Integration:**
- TokemonGo innovatively uses `Circle`'s USDC, merging the stability of traditional finance with the dynamic world of GameFi and SocialFi, to create a secure and efficient gaming economy.

## How To Run?

```bash

cd TokemonGo
cp .env.example .env
# After copying the .env.example file to .env, you'll need to fill in the following fields in the .env file:

# ETHER_SCAN_API_KEY="" - Your API key for Etherscan,.
# to install packages
pnpm install -r
pnpm -w run test 
```

**Important Testing Note:**

Due to the nature of forking test networks, running all tests simultaneously can lead to interference between them. To ensure accurate and reliable test results, it's recommended to run tests individually. This approach prevents potential conflicts and guarantees the integrity of the testing process. 

For a comprehensive test with a single command, you can use:
```
pnpm -w run test 
```

Alternatively, to run specific tests independently and avoid any overlap, use the following commands:
```
pnpm --filter tokemon-go-contracts exec hardhat test test/TokemoGoTest.ts 
pnpm --filter tokemon-go-contracts exec hardhat test test/AutoDepositDysonTest.ts 
```

These steps ensure that each test is executed in isolation, providing clear and precise outcomes.
